Hello!

If you are reading this then you have found my GitHub! I have been coding for over 5 years and thought now was as good a time as any to create a GitHub to incentivise me to work on more Data Science projects outside of work!

So go get some tea and maybe a scone or packet of M&Ms and let's begin our journey :)

Best,
Lauren
